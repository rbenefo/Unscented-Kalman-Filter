# Unscented-Kalman-Filter
A Python implementation of an Unscented Kalman Filter for estimating the orientation of a quadcopter given gyroscope and accelerometer data.

Based on the paper ["A Quaternion-based Unscented Kalman Filter for Orientation Tracking" by Edgar Kraft from the University of Bonn](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/uploads/Arun/UKFpaper.pdf).
